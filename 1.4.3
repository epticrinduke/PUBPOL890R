# 1) Make a bar plot of species of penguins,
# where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?

ggplot(penguins, aes(y = fct_infreq(species))) +
  geom_bar()
# This plot displays horizontal bars instead of vertical bars.

# 2) How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic,
# color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
geom_bar(color = "red")

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
geom_bar(fill = "red")

# Using color changes the outline of a bar, while fill changes
# the inside of the bar. So, fill is more useful for changing bar colors.

# 3) What does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?

# The bins argument splits a continuous variable into bars
# with a specified width based on the variable values. In general, the smaller
# the bin value, the more bars in a histogram.

# 4) Make a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset
# that is available when you load the tidyverse package.
# Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals
# the most interesting patterns?

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01)

# The smallest binwidth I tried (.01) revealed a number of preferred carat
# sizes for cutting diamonds at .1 increments below 1 carat,
# and .25 increments over 1 carat.
