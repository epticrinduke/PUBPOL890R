#1. Use geom_text() with infinite positions to place text at the four corners 
#of the plot.

label <- tribble(
  ~displ, ~hwy, ~label, ~vjust, ~hjust,
  Inf, Inf, "Top right", "top", "right",
  Inf, -Inf, "Bottom right", "bottom", "right",
  -Inf, Inf, "Top left", "top", "left",
  -Inf, -Inf, "Bottom left", "bottom", "left"
)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = label, vjust = vjust, hjust = hjust), data = label)

#2. Use annotate() to add a point geom in the middle of your last plot without
#having to create a tibble. Customize the shape, size, or color of the point.

ggplot (mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point()

#3.How do labels with geom_text() interact with faceting? How can you add a 
#label to a single facet? How can you put a different label in each facet?'
#(Hint: Think about the dataset that is being passed to geom_text().)

#Normally, if the facet variable isn't specified then the text is drawn in
#full facets. In order to draw the label in a single facet, you need to add
#a column to the label data frame with the value of faceting variables to 
#draw from.When it comes to adding a different label to each facet, the 
#facetting variables need to be assigned when you write add the tibble
#when you are using the geo_text command.

label <- tibble(
  displ = Inf,
  hwy = Inf,
  class = "2seater",
  label = "Increasing engine size is \nrelated to decreasing fuel economy."
)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = label),
            data = label, vjust = "top", hjust = "right",
            size = 2
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~class)


label <- tibble(
  displ = Inf,
  hwy = Inf,
  class = unique(mpg$class),
  label = str_c("Label for ", class)
)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = label),
            data = label, vjust = "top", hjust = "right",
            size = 3
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~class)



#4. What arguments to geom_label() control the appearance of the background box?

#The arguments that control the appearance of the background are label.padding, 
#label.r, and label.size.

#5. What are the four arguments to arrow()? How do they work? Create a series 
#of plots that demonstrate the most important options.

#Below are the four arguments to arrow(): 

#angle - angle of arrow head
#length - length of the arrow head
#ends - ends of the line to draw arrow head
#type - "open" or "close": whether the arrow head is a closed or open triangle
