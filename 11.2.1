# 1. Create one plot on the fuel economy data with customized title, subtitle,
# caption, x, y, and color labels.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Number of cylinders in engine",
    y = "Highway fuel economy (mpg)",
    color = "Type of vehicle",
    title = "Fuel economy decreases with a more powerful engine",
    subtitle = "Most 8-cylinder vehicles are SUVs or subcompact vehicles,
    showing a need to power big vehicles or a desire to drive for sport",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )

# 2. Recreate the following plot using the fuel economy data. Note that both
# the colors and shapes of points vary by type of drive train.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv, shape = drv)) +
  labs(
    x = "City MPG",
    y = "Highway MPG",
    color = "Type of drive train",
    shape = "Type of drive train"
  )

# 3. Take an exploratory graphic that you've created in the last month, and add
# informative titles to make it easier for others to understand.

# From 9.3.1 Exercise:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(color = "white", shape = 21, stroke = 2, aes(fill = drv)) +
  labs(
    x = "Engine displacement in liters",
    y = "Highway MPG",
    color = "Type of drive train",
    shape = "Type of drive train",
    title = "Fuel economy decreases as engine size increases",
    subtitle = "4-wheel drive cars decrease fuel economy",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )
