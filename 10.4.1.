#Exercise Set 6
#10.4.1

#1) What happens to missing values in a histogram? What happens to missing values in a bar chart? Why is there a difference in how missing values are handled
#in histograms and bar charts?

#Missing values are removed when the number of observations in each bin are calculated. 
See the warning message: Removed 9 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin)
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>%
  mutate(y = ifelse(y < 3 | y > 20, NA, y))
ggplot(diamonds2, aes(x = y)) +
  geom_histogram()
#In the geom_bar() function, NA is treated as another category. The x aesthetic in geom_bar() requires a discrete (categorical) variable, and missing values
#act like another category.
diamonds %>%
  mutate(cut = if_else(runif(n()) < 0.1, NA_character_, as.character(cut))) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
#In a histogram, the x aesthetic variable needs to be numeric, and stat_bin() groups the observations by ranges into bins. 
#Since the numeric value of the NA observations is unknown, they cannot be placed in a particular bin, and are dropped.

#2) What does na.rm = TRUE do in mean() and sum()?

#This option removes NA values from the vector prior to calculating the mean and sum.
mean(c(0, 1, 2, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
sum(c(0, 1, 2, NA), na.rm = TRUE)

#3) Recreate the frequency plot of scheduled_dep_time colored by whether the flight was cancelled or not. Also facet by the cancelled variable. 
#Experiment with different values of the scales variable in the faceting function to mitigate the effect of more non-cancelled flights than 
#cancelled flights.

nycflights13::flights %>%
  mutate(
    cancelled = is.na(dep_time),
    sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
    sched_min = sched_dep_time %% 100,
    sched_dep_time = sched_hour + sched_min / 60
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = sched_dep_time, x = cancelled))
