# 1) Create a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ where the points
# are pink filled in triangles.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(shape = 17, color = "pink")

# 2) Why did the following code not result in a plot with blue points?
  
  ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue""))
  
# This applies a label to color rather than a color because it's
# under the aes() argument. If you want the color to be blue, code it like this:

  ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", aes(x = displ, y = hwy))  

# 3) What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with?
# (Hint: use ?geom_point)

# The stroke aesthetic changes the thickness of the borders of the point shape.
# It works with all shapes with a border.

# 4) What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than
# a variable name, like aes(color = displ < 5)?
# Note, youâ€™ll also need to specify x and y.

  ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))
  
# The graph creates a true-false color scheme to visualize whether the variable
# meets the named criteria.
