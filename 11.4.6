# 1.Why doesnâ€™t the following code override the default scale?

df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10000),
  y = rnorm(10000)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +
  coord_fixed()

# scale_color_gradient doesn't work because the colors in geom_hex use a fill,
# not a color aesthetic.

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red")
  

# 2. What is the first argument to every scale? How does it compare to labs()?

# The first argument to every scale is labeling. This functions the same way
# as the labs() function.

# 3. Change the display of the presidential terms by:
#   a. Combining the two variants that customize colors and x axis breaks.
#   b. Improving the display of the y axis.
#   c. Labelling each term with the name of the president.
#   d. Adding informative plot labels.
#   e. Placing breaks every 4 years (this is trickier than it seems!).

presidential |> 
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = start, y = id, color = party)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = name)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c(Republican = "#E81B23", Democratic = "#00AEF3")) +
    scale_x_date("Year", date_breaks = "4 years", date_labels = "'%y") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(35, 40, 45), labels = c("35th", "40th", "45th")) +
    labs(x = "Year",
         y ="US President Number",
         color = "Party Affiliation",
         title = "US President Term Lengths",
         subtitle = "from inauguration to removal from office")

# 4. First, create the following plot. Then, modify the code using override.aes
# to make the legend easier to see.

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut), alpha = 1/20) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
