#1) What is distinct() translated to? How about head()?

#> <SQL>
#> SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
#> FROM table_name

#> <SQL>
#> SELECT *
#> FROM table_name

#2)Explain what each of the following SQL queries do and try recreate them
#using dbplyr.

#> <SQL>
#> SELECT * 
#>   FROM flights
#>   WHERE dep_delay < arr_delay

#This query selects all columns where the arrival delays is larger than 
#departure delays.

library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)
flights %>%
  filter(dep_delay < arr_delay) %>%
  collect()

#>   SELECT *, distance / (air_time / 60) AS speed
#>   FROM flights

#This query selects all columns from the flights and calculates the speed
#(distance divided by air time in hours) for each flight

library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)
flights %>%
  mutate(speed = distance / (air_time / 60)) %>%
  select(everything()) %>%
  collect()  # To retrieve the result
