# Exercise 2
# Yvonne Ma

# 1. Why does this code not work?

my_variable <- 10
my_varıable

# The object "my_varıable" is not found, because it uses "ı" instead of "i", so in R's view there only exists "my_variable", not "my_varıable",
# and R cannot recognize it

# 2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

libary(todyverse)

ggplot(dTA = mpg) + 
  geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm)
"

# Correct as follows:

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(
  data = mpg,
  mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Do we have to do "  geom_smooth(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), method = "lm")"?
# can we omit aes(x,y) inside geo_smooth as above?

# 3. Press Option + Shift + K / Alt + Shift + K. What happens?
# How can you get to the same place using the menus?

# I open the keyboard shortcut quick reference. I can also get to it in tools.

# 4. Let’s revisit an exercise from the Section 1.6.
# Run the following lines of code.
my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)
# Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

# The bar plot was saved as mpg-plot.png, because the command is to save the bar plot.
