#Exercise 9.4.1 

#1 What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ cty)

#The continuous variable will end up being changed to a categorical variable
#The plot will end up containing a facet for each distinct value.

#2. What do the empty cells in the plot above with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? 
#Run the following code. How do they relate to the resulting plot?

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = drv, y = cyl))

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

#The empty cells in the facet_grid plot are a combination of drv and cyl 
#variables that have no observations. 

#3. What plots does the following code make? What does . do?

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

#The code facet_grid(.~cyl) will facet the codes on the x-axis, while 
#facet_grid(drvg~.) will facet the codes on the y-axis.

#4. Take the first faceted plot in this section:

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))

#What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the color aesthetic?
#What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger
#dataset?

#When using faceting over the color aesthetic the faceting the number of 
#categories and points increase. When using coloring there will be an
#overlapping of points with different colors making it hard to visually
#pick out patterns of different categories. 

#Disadvantages of using faceting over the color aesthetic is that it will be 
#difficult to compare values between categories since each observation 
#for each category are on different plots. 

#If a larger data set is used and the number of categories increases, then
#the differences between colors decreases. This keeps points affected by 
#the color of each category in the color aesthetic less visually distinct.

#5.Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? 
#What other options control the layout of the individual panels? 
#Why doesnâ€™t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?

#Ncol and Nrow determines the number or rows or columns to use when making
#facets.This helps since facet_wrap only facets one variable.
#Facet_grid doesn't have nrow or ncol because these arguments are not 
#necessary. The number of unique values of variables are instead used to 
#determine the number of rows and columns. 

#6. Which of the following plots makes it easier to compare engine size (displ) 
#across cars with different drive trains? What does this say about when to
#place a faceting variable across rows or columns?

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(. ~ drv)

#The facet_grd(.~ drv) plot makes it easier to compare engine size across
#cars with different trains.This plot shows that it is easier to read 
#and determine a more accurate count using the facet_grid(. ~ drv) when
# faceting variables across rows or columns.

#7. Recreate the following plot using facet_wrap() instead of facet_grid().
#How do the positions of the facet labels change?

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(drv ~ .)

#When the facet_grid(drv ~ .) is used the labels there more emphasis on the 
#coding to expand the view x-axis to see the variables faceted. In 
#facet_wrap(drv ~.) there is a vertical expansion of the plot to see how
#the vairiables were faceted on the y-axis.
